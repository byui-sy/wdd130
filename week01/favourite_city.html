    <h1>City of Singapore, Singapore</h1>
    <p>Singapore is unique in that it is a country and a city. A tiny island on the southern tip of
        the Malaysian Peninsular in South East Asia.</p>
    <p>It is a safe, peaceful, vibrant and bustling city where the world comes together to enjoy the
        different cultures and food.
    <p>The picture shows the Merlion which is one of the icons of Singapore. One of the many
        favourite places for a good photo shoot.</p>
