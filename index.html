        <p>Hello, my name is Sook Yin Jewell and my friends call me Denise.
            I am from Singapore, a small country in South East Asia.<br>
            I have always wanted to build a website for myself and hopefully I will gain some
            knowledge from this course.<br>
            I enjoy good music, songs and books. I love nature and enjoy hiking with a small
            group of friends.<br>
            I take time to appreciate life and enjoy God's wonderful creations around me.</p>

        <img src="images/landmarks-of-singapore.jpg" alt="Singapore" width="200">
        <p>Singapore is a modern and multicultural country. It has no natural resources and it
            thrives on her human resources to
            be where we are today, a dynamic and developed nation. The Merlion and the Marina Bay
            Sands
            Hotel in the Marina Bay are recognised as symbols of Singapore worldwide.
